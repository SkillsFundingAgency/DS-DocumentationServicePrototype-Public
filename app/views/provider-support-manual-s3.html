<h2 id="what-to-include-on-the-ilr">4.1 - What to include on the ILR</h2>


<p>You must include on the ILR all learners who have attended one episode of learning.</p>
<p>Aims that are completed or withdrawn during the current ILR year (Completion status =2 or 3 and Learning actual end date is on or after 1 August 2018 and before 1 August 2019) .</p>

<p>If a learner withdraws without completing one episode of learning – for example, without attending the first class – then they must not be included on the ILR.</p>

<p>Your ILR returns must include all aims that meet the criteria below, and any aims for the previous year that have since been corrected.</p>

<p>Any aims reported as continuing in the final return (R14) for the previous year that are not reported in the current year will be treated as withdrawn in the qualification achievement rates (QARs).</p>

<p>Details about migrating data from between years can be found in Appendix B of the ILR specification, including details about changes that may affect learners continuing from the previous year and those learners on a break in learning.</p>

<p>Migration is the process by which ILR data is converted from one academic year to the next.</p>


<p>If you think that your service (or any part of it) can’t be made accessible, contact the Government Digital Service (<abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr>) accessibility team for advice at <a href="mailto:accessibility@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">accessibility@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learner-details-completing-the-learner-entity">4.2 - Learner details: completing the Learner entity</h2>

<p>The data recorded in the Learner entity contains basic information about the learner such as their name, date of birth, sex and ethnicity.</p>

<p>You can only return one record on the Learner entity for each learner.</p>

<p>The learner’s name, date of birth and sex should match the data held by the Learning Records Service (LRS). If any of the learner’s details change, this should be recorded on the ILR and the data held by the LRS updated.</p>

<p>The following entities contain data that may not be required for all learners. See the individual field pages in the specification for data requirement details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact Preference – indicates the learner’s wishes about contact for marketing, research and survey purposes</li>
  <li>LLDD and Health Problem – additional information about a learner’s disabilities, learning difficulty and/or health problem
  </li>
  <li>Employment Status and Employment Status Monitoring – monitoring of a learner’s employment status</li>
  <li>Learner Funding and Monitoring – additional data to support funding and learner monitoring</li>
  <li>Learner Provider Specified Monitoring – additional provider data used as required and specified by the provider</li>
  <li>Learner HE and Learner HE Financial support – HE data fields</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="off-the-job-training-hours-4-2-3" style="padding-top:15px;">4.2.3 Off-the-job training hours</h3>
<p>This is a new field for 2018 to 2019. This field is the cumulative total of actual off-the-job training hours (as defined in the funding rules) delivered to date, to the individual apprentice, in the academic year by the training provider, sub-contracted training providers and the employer.</p>

<p>204. This field is optional for providers to complete on the ILR. If completed this field is recorded to the nearest whole hour and should be updated monthly.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-is-the-whole-teams-job">Accessibility is the whole team’s job</h2>

<p>Accessibility isn’t the responsibility of just one person. Everyone on your team is responsible for making sure your service is accessible.</p>

<p>It’s important that each person on your team - especially content designers, interaction designers and developers - understands how they might accidentally make something inaccessible and can avoid doing so.</p>

<p>User researchers and testers can help spot accessibility problems so the rest of the team can remove them.</p>

<p>Product and delivery managers should also understand accessibility so they can ensure it’s considered from the start and built in to the service efficiently.</p>

<p>Read more about how each discipline can help build an accessible service in the US government’s <a rel="external" href="https://accessibility.digital.gov/">Accessibility for Teams guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="researching-with-users-with-disabilities">Researching with users with disabilities</h2>

<p>When doing research, you have to include users who have disabilities or use assistive technologies.</p>

<p>You may need to pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants#finding-recruitment-agencies">recruitment agency</a> to help you find participants</li>
  <li>expenses to help participants take part in research - this might include a helper, taxis, or someone to help with communication like a sign language interpreter</li>
</ul>

<p>Learn more about <a href="/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants">recruiting participants for user research</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-accessibility-in-discovery">What to do about accessibility in discovery</h2>

<p>During discovery you should be learning how people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive impairments might use your service, as well as the barriers they face.</p>

<p>You can do this even before you do any user research by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-accessibility-2/">developing a clear understanding of what accessibility means</a> as you explore the problem you’re trying to solve</li>
  <li>trying to understand the <a rel="external" href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/consider-the-range-of-people-that-will-use-your-product-or-service/">range of abilities users can have</a>
</li>
  <li>reading <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles">profiles of users with disabilities</a> to understand how accessibility affects individual users</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also join the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community">accessibility community</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-in-alpha">What to do about accessibility in alpha</h2>

<p>During alpha, you should be thinking about whether what you’re designing meets the <a href="/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20#wcag-design-principles"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 design principles</a> - this will help you meet the needs of all your users.</p>

<p>You should also start thinking about your <a href="/service-manual/technology/testing-for-accessibility#getting-an-accessibility-audit">accessibility audit</a>. Even though you won’t need this until beta, it can take time to arrange. You may have someone in your department with the necessary skills and auditing experience to do this. If not, you will need to appoint an external accessibility specialist.</p>

<p>You can ask your auditor to spend a couple of days during alpha reviewing your designs and <a href="/service-manual/design/making-prototypes">prototypes</a> for potential accessibility problems.</p>

<p>You can also improve what you’re designing by <a href="/service-manual/user-research/running-research-sessions-with-people-with-disabilities">running research sessions with users with disabilities</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-in-beta">What to do about accessibility in beta</h2>

<p>During beta, you need to start <a href="/service-manual/technology/testing-for-accessibility">testing for accessibility</a> and get an accessibility audit.</p>

<p>Running a combination of manual and automated tests each time you develop a new feature means you can sort out issues that could be costly to fix at a later stage.</p>

<p>Check what testing tools and software your team has access to in case you need to pay for some.</p>

<p><a href="/service-manual/user-research/running-research-sessions-with-people-with-disabilities">Running research sessions with users who have disabilities</a> will also help you check that what you’re building is accessible.</p>

<h3 id="getting-an-accessibility-audit">Getting an accessibility audit</h3>

<p>You must get an accessibility audit towards the end of beta, which will provide evidence at assessment that your service works with assistive technologies and meets <a href="/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 level AA</a>. This can take time to arrange, so start planning for it during alpha.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-for-accessibility#getting-an-accessibility-audit">how to get an accessibility audit</a> including how to find a supplier.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-accessibility-in-live">What to do about accessibility in live</h2>

<p>It’s important to carry on testing and researching your service once it’s live.</p>

<p>Check that any new features you add meet government accessibility requirements, and continue doing research with users with disabilities.</p>

<p>If you make substantial changes to your service, you can get another audit to check you still meet government accessibility requirements.</p>

<h2 id="make-non-digital-parts-of-your-service-accessible">Make non-digital parts of your service accessible</h2>

<p>You should also make sure the non-digital parts of your service are accessible.
For example, you should make sure that users who are deaf or have a speech impairment are offered a way to contact you (by text, email or in person with a British Sign Language translator or lip reader).</p>

<p>If you have to send out letters as part of your service, make sure you can also provide these in alternative formats that are accessible (for example large print, braille or audio CD).</p>
